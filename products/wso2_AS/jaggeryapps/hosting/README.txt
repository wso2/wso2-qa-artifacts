Sending Emails using Jaggery Sender API
---------------------------------------
- both email1.zip & email2.zip jaggery apps will do the same.
- You have to open the email.jag file and alter the relevant fields (to, from, cc, bcc, frompassword) accordingly.
- Deploy the jaggery app in wso2 products such as AS or AppFactory. Invoking the app will send an email to specified receivers using jaggery sender api.


NOTE: You may need to alter the sender account security, because acounts such as gmail will block the request by default.
